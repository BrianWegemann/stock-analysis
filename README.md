# Stock Analysis

## Summary
### The purpose of this project is to use VBA assist our friend with quickly identifying profitable stocks in 2017 and 2018.

## Results
## Stock Performance by Year
### The selected stocks had a much better year in 2017 than they did in 2018. In 2017, the selected stocks had an average return of 67.3%. These stocks were performing incredibly well and would have seemed like a sound investment. However, the average return in 2018 was an awful -8.5% loss. Despite the largely poor perfomance of these stocks in 2018, two stocks did have a high retun: RUN and ENPH. As we can see in the photos below, RUN and ENPH had a respective return of 5.5% and 129.5% in 2017, and 84% and 81.9% in 2018. These would be great stocks to recommend to our friend.
